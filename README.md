<h1>SoaromaSAC</h2>
After developing it for a few years, it's time for me to make SoaromaSAC open source (which was my first ever project)! Do note that I didn't really know Java or programming that well at all when I first started developing this, and I didn't have any help, so the anti-cheat may not follow industry-standard practices. Obviously, nowadays I would redo it entirely to make sure it does, but it's a pretty big project to redo entirely.


<h2>SoaromaSAC is an anti-cheat that stands for Soaroma Simple Anti Cheat</h2>
<p> Its purpose is to detect cheaters within minecraft using the spigot/bukkit API </p>
